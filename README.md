# Firefly-Esk8-Remotes-IntegratedPCB
Based on solidgeek's shared 32U4 chip schematic design, replacement of the charge management chip and LDO3.3v chip. Please note that the design is not complete and some circuits need to be optimized. Please wait for the follow-up update. If you have suggestions, please feel free to tell me.
